# iStation Data

I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the time students spent on iStation (a reading program) and the growth they made on their iStation assessments. Here is the link to the Tableau dashboard: [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/IstationGrowthvsPractice/Sheet1/Dashboard%201#1)

I found that there was no significant correlation between the two. I believe that I do not have a large enough sample size to effectively draw any conclusions, as I only have access to my school's data. It does seem, however, that the students' growth is more largely influenced by other factors, such as teacher instruction, than how much time theyu spend on the program.
